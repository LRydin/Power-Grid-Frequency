# Power-Grid-Frequency-Data

Power-grid frequency data from around the world, cleaned and processed for research usage

The data is collected from the TSO's and is processed to remove dead recordings, spikes, and other naturally assumed bad measurements. The scripts that are used to clean the data are also included, for transparency.

The

# European Grids

Available are recording from the Continental Europe (UTCE) area: Germany, France.
From Great Britain (United Kingdom). From the Nordic Grid, from Fingrid.

## Germany - TransNet BW
These recordings are obtained from the [TransNet BW](https://www.transnetbw.com/en/energy-market/ancillary-services/control-reserve-demand-activation)
